# climatejoe
"Twitter Bot" to gather climate news hourly and retweet using node.js


Climate joe checks twitter once an hour for random 10 hashtags of #climatechange and then retweets one of them.

Climate joe was mainly just a fun project I decided to throw together one morning after being inspired by the [Partially Derivative](http://www.partiallyderivative.com/) podcast.

If you want a skeleton for a twitter-bot that is actually not a nuisance, this is a nice one.

A big secret is that you need a number to make it work. To get a "free phone number"-- you can use "Google Voice" but register the account to an email which is your email + something @gmail.com.
There's a few tutorials on google for setting up google voice.

Anyway, I probably won't maintain Climate joe past where he is now, but feel free to fork him and make him do silly things.
